static const Color secondaryOrange = Color(0xFFFF9800);
```

  // ...
];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Flutter not found"
```bash
# Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
flutter doctor
```

### "Build failed"
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### "No devices found"
```bash
# Check connected devices
flutter devices

# Or use emulator
# Android: Start emulator from Android Studio
# iOS: Run simulator from Xcode
```

### "API not working"
- Normal! App uses mock data by default
- Check `lib/services/api_service.dart` - it has automatic fallback
